|I abhorred the face of man                                                                                                                                            |1589.83   |
|I took the hand of Elizabeth                                                                                                                                          |1588.0    |
|I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves                                                                                      |1582.53   |
|I examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood                                                                                    |1423.44   |
|My mule was brought to the door and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert                                                                                  |1394.24   |
|I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin                                                                                                  |1389.73   |
|Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage the door opened and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared                                                     |1358.6    |
|But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure                                                                                                         |1357.46   |
|I thought I saw Elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of Ingolstadt                                                                                 |1326.0    |
|Often after the rest of the family had retired for the night I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water                                                     |1289.48   |
|I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me                                         |1282.61   |
|I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland                                                                                   |1279.06   |
|How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south                                                                                                                    |1276.36   |
|My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses I accompanied them to the court                                                             |1267.65   |
|In the morning I went to the court my lips and throat were parched                                                                                                    |1266.43   |
|I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny                                                                                                     |1256.92   |
|I inquired the way to the inn but no one replied                                                                                                                      |1241.36   |
|I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased                                                                               |1240.62   |
|Could he be I shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother                                                                                                  |1237.62   |
|I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean                                                                              |1237.41   |
|I was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn                                                                                    |1233.57   |
|The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal                                                                |1227.89   |
|Thus I returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family                                                                                            |1226.38   |
|She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself                                                                                                                          |1225.88   |
|But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell                                                                                                         |1220.57   |
|Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable                                                                                           |1214.57   |
|He had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him                                                                                                    |1214.43   |
|No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night which I spent cold and wet in the open air                                               |1213.5    |
|I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber                                                                                                               |1205.2    |
|I told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising                                                          |1201.86   |
|But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and I gradually recovered my health                                                              |1201.52   |
|I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura and the bright summit of Mont Blanc                                                                              |1194.25   |
|The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me                                                                   |1193.37   |
|I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it                                                                                                                             |1192.33   |
|I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror                                                                                                                      |1191.6    |
|Soon after I entered the valley of Chamounix                                                                                                                          |1187.62   |
|This picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed                                                                            |1171.5    |
|Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness                                                                                |1169.38   |
|Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva                                                                                                                     |1167.0    |
|I performed the first part of my journey on horseback                                                                                                                 |1164.4    |
|It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent                                                                                                            |1155.85   |
|I replied carelessly and partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied                                               |1150.1    |
|But the overflowing misery I now felt and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion                                                |1148.76   |
|Day dawned and I directed my steps towards the town                                                                                                                   |1146.1    |

|Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory                                         |5.922895071638693e-94|

|They did not prove that the colour is in the mind of the percipient                                                                                                   |892.14    |
|Nevertheless the probability of the general law is increased by repetitions just as the probability of the particular case is                                         |828.55    |
|the sense-datum as the mark of some physical object                                                                                                                   |811.67    |
|But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of _thought_ is nevertheless erroneous                                                                      |793.88    |
|This question is of the greatest importance                                                                                                                           |791.43    |
|This is however only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of philosophy                                                                                     |761.29    |
|But the notion of being 'in ' the mind is ambiguous                                                                                                                   |755.27    |
|In the empirical case the evidence consists in the particular instances                                                                                               |737.18    |
|In this therefore which was the most important point of the controversy the rationalists were in the right                                                            |732.33    |
|Such as it is it is obtained through acquaintance with the sense-data that make up the appearance of the table                                                        |732.1     |
|Thus a problem arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table supposing there is such a thing                                                          |730.67    |
|The shape of the table is no better                                                                                                                                   |727.25    |
|In the strict sense it is not whiteness that is in our mind but the act of thinking of whiteness                                                                      |720.65    |
|The essence of the sort of entity that Plato meant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in sensation                                         |712.42    |
|My knowledge of the table is of the kind which we shall call 'knowledge by description '                                                                              |709.94    |
|There is a similar hierarchy in the region of universals                                                                                                              |702.1     |
|This relation therefore is a relation of four terms since Othello also is one of the terms of the relation                                                            |701.65    |
|This is the sense in which we know sense-data                                                                                                                         |700.11    |
|This constitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search of                                                                                      |686.93    |
|This is the kind of criticism which constitutes philosophy                                                                                                            |685.44    |
|There is another point of great importance in which the empiricists were in the right as against the rationalists                                                     |683.05    |
|The real space is public the apparent space is private to the percipient                                                                                              |678.38    |
|Thus we have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects                                                                                               |674.42    |
|to the things apprehended by our acts of apprehension                                                                                                                 |671.44    |
|The colour is that _of_ which we are immediately aware and the awareness itself is the sensation                                                                      |668.41    |
|This world is of great importance to philosophy and in particular to the problems of _a priori_ knowledge                                                             |661.44    |
|such that the opposite would be self-contradictory and secondly for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of knowledge                       |660.29    |
|As the first of the problems connected with knowledge of truths let us examine the nature and scope of our intuitive judgements                                       |656.91    |
|On the other hand when a belief is _false_ there is no such complex unity composed only of the objects of the belief                                                  |656.65    |
|My knowledge of the table as a physical object on the contrary is not direct knowledge                                                                                |656.38    |
|This essential incompleteness appears according to Hegel equally in the world of thought and in the world of things                                                   |648.95    |
|In our case the data are merely the known cases of coexistence of A and B                                                                                             |642.06    |
|The only thing constant so long as the name is rightly used is the object to which the name applies                                                                   |624.9     |
|We may now take a survey of the sources of our knowledge as they have appeared in the course of our analysis                                                          |622.82    |
|There is no difficulty in supposing this to be the case                                                                                                               |614.73    |
|There is a confusion when this use of the word 'nature ' is employed between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths                                              |613.77    |
|But in spite of the truth of their belief they can not be said to have knowledge                                                                                      |609.76    |
|An example of such principles perhaps the most important example is the inductive principle which we considered in the preceding chapter                              |607.71    |
|This kind of acquaintance which may be called self-consciousness is the source of all our knowledge of mental things                                                  |605.11    |
|The reference to the future in this question is not essential                                                                                                         |603.91    |
|In such a case we say that our knowledge of the object is knowledge by description                                                                                    |603.75    |
|The cement is the relation 'believing '                                                                                                                               |603.29    |
|2 In the second use of the word 'know ' above the word applies to our knowledge of _things_ which we may call _acquaintance_                                          |602.29    |
|When a belief is true we said there is a corresponding fact in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex                                          |600.33    |
|Yet the knowledge of such general propositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally admitted to be known                                               |594.64    |
|to what we have called the 'physical object ' the other due to our own nature                                                                                         |586.5     |
|In the main this view is just                                                                                                                                         |584.57    |
|But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind is unreasonable                                                                                           |577.14    |
|The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex and we subject it to some degree of analysis                                                                |575.55    |
|Yet it would be absurd to say that the reader does not _know_ that the newspaper announces the King 's death                                                          |575.05    |
|we have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either of the outer senses or of the inner sense                                                      |574.57    |
|But for the sake of illustration let us assume that we think of him as 'the first Chancellor of the German Empire '                                                   |573.87    |
|We have first to distinguish knowledge of things and knowledge of truths                                                                                              |569.67    |
|We can give instances of the associated sense-data but we can not give instances of the actual physical objects                                                       |569.63    |
|But I perceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts and some parts are above other parts                                                        |569.57    |
|In this chapter we have to see why this is the case                                                                                                                   |566.33    |
|This is a question of the very greatest difficulty to which no completely satisfactory answer is possible                                                             |566.18    |
|It seems plain that it is not thought which produces the truth of the proposition ' I am in my room '                                                                 |562.73    |
|When it is said that light _is_ waves what is really meant is that waves are the physical cause of our sensations of light                                            |561.75    |
|Hegel 's philosophy is very difficult and commentators differ as to the true interpretation of it                                                                     |557.0     |
|Similarly if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello the constituents of the judgement are still the same but their order is different                             |556.91    |
|not analytic in all these propositions no analysis of the subject will reveal the predicate                                                                           |555.47    |
|1 Kant 's 'thing in itself ' is identical in _definition_ with the physical object namely it is the cause of sensations                                               |553.59    |
|Such cases are common in the experience of every mathematician                                                                                                        |552.7     |
|Thus a description will mean any phrase of the form 'the so-and-so ' in the singular                                                                                  |552.25    |
|The world of universals therefore may also be described as the world of being                                                                                         |551.21    |
|Thus the scope and power of _a priori_ principles is strictly limited                                                                                                 |549.25    |
|they can be shown to be not cases of memory in the strict sense at all                                                                                                |547.0     |
|the sort of universals generally represented by verbs and prepositions                                                                                                |543.7     |
|But knowledge of truths raises a further problem which does not arise in regard to knowledge of things namely the problem of _error_                                  |541.87    |
|In like manner I become aware of the relation of before and after in time                                                                                             |539.07    |
|Hence the relation 'north of ' is radically different from such things                                                                                                |537.58    |
|We can not therefore include as part of the value of philosophy any definite set of answers to such questions                                                         |537.45    |
|Here we have a relation between two places and it seems plain that the relation subsists independently of our knowledge of it                                         |537.36    |
|The chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience                                            |534.48    |
|Thus there must be intuitive judgements of memory and it is upon them ultimately that all our knowledge of the past depends                                           |534.23    |
|This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects                                                          |532.47    |
|Thus whenever we see a colour we have a sensation _of_ the colour but the colour itself is a sense-datum not a sensation                                              |528.7     |
|We have a firm belief that it will rise in the future because it has risen in the past                                                                                |526.74    |
|For the probability that Socrates is mortal is greater on our data than the probability that all men are mortal                                                       |523.45    |
|We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles commonly called 'laws of thought '                                                                             |522.53    |
|It is this question and not our previous question as to the difference between sense-data and the physical object that must now concern us                            |522.25    |
|It is usually through particular instances that we come to be able to see the general principle                                                                       |521.0     |
|The belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about things not only about thoughts                                                                               |520.62    |
|In our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour and shape the colour is red and the shape is round                                             |519.5     |
|If this doubt is raised we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about the sunrise was first raised                                                   |518.41    |
|an act of thought and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental                                                                                                  |516.43    |
|_A priori_ knowledge is not all of the logical kind we have been hitherto considering                                                                                 |516.27    |
|Its truth is just as indubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two other phenomena make four phenomena                                         |516.09    |
|Similarly we may be aware of our feeling pleasure or pain and generally of the events which happen in our minds                                                       |514.57    |
|A particular patch of colour which I see for example simply exists it is not the sort of thing that is true or false                                                  |512.08    |
|But the 'real ' shape is not what we see it is something inferred from what we see                                                                                    |506.83    |
|Let us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance                                                                                                     |505.2     |
|In this case it might seem as though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property rather than with the property                                        |503.43    |
|This sort of knowledge may be described as knowledge of _truths_                                                                                                      |503.09    |
|But then the resemblance required will have to be a universal                                                                                                         |502.82    |
|But first of all we must examine our knowledge of universals                                                                                                          |502.64    |
|There is no place or time where we can find the relation 'north of '                                                                                                  |502.4     |
|But as regards knowledge of truths there is a dualism                                                                                                                 |502.4     |
|It is this preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter                                                                                             |502.38    |
|If we believe that there is such a universal we shall say that things are white because they have the quality of whiteness                                            |501.48    |
|The one thing we know about it is that it is not what it seems                                                                                                        |500.87    |
|The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic                                                             |500.68    |
|Let us take as an illustration the law of contradiction                                                                                                               |498.8     |
|Thus this sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of truth                                                                                                     |498.0     |
|In order to understand his argument it is necessary to understand his use of the word 'idea '                                                                         |497.94    |
|How are we to know in a given case that our belief is not erroneous                                                                                                   |497.47    |
|To assert this is certainly within the scope of what we mean when we state that two and two are four                                                                  |495.0     |
|Kant 's solution of the problem though not valid in my opinion is interesting                                                                                         |494.93    |
|It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a 'sense ' or 'direction '                                                                        |494.89    |
|We can know _only_ what is required in order to secure the correspondence                                                                                             |493.69    |
|We are not only aware of things but we are often aware of being aware of them                                                                                         |490.06    |
|The interesting doubt is as to whether the laws of motion will remain in operation until to-morrow                                                                    |489.47    |
|We do not believe it because we see a connexion between the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_                                                                |488.61    |
|But if it does correspond in the sense explained in the preceding chapter then it _must_ be true                                                                      |484.83    |
|The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the theory that truth consists in _coherence_                                                              |484.56    |
|But we can not hope to be acquainted directly with the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red                                                 |483.26    |
|They are called 'analytic ' because the predicate is obtained by merely analysing the subject                                                                         |483.2     |
|When we say 'the so-and-so exists ' we mean that there is just one object which is the so-and-so                                                                      |482.89    |
|The question remains whether there is any other method of discovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects                                                        |481.94    |
|Again different people see the same object as of different shapes according to their point of view                                                                    |479.47    |
|Thus it is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief                                                                           |479.05    |
|When what we believe is true it might be supposed that we had achieved a knowledge of what we believe                                                                 |478.55    |
|These physical objects are in the space of science which we may call 'physical ' space                                                                                |478.19    |
|Suppose for example that we are thinking of whiteness                                                                                                                 |477.22    |
|It will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple terms of which the meaning is definite and clear                                                  |476.5     |
|Our nature is as much a fact of the existing world as anything and there can be no certainty that it will remain constant                                             |476.38    |
|For example the law of contradiction states that nothing can both have a certain property and not have it                                                             |473.26    |
|The mental act is undoubtedly mental but is there any reason to suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense mental                                             |472.36    |
|This property of having a 'sense ' or 'direction ' is one which the relation of judging shares with all other relations                                               |472.09    |
|But if the reality is not what appears have we any means of knowing whether there is any reality at all                                                               |471.71    |
|Another relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is resemblance                                                                                  |465.86    |
|But if we mean this we shall have to admit that what _in this sense_ is in the mind may nevertheless be not mental                                                    |465.12    |
|Of course similar things happen in dreams where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people                                                                   |464.78    |
|The value of philosophy is in fact to be sought largely in its very uncertainty                                                                                       |464.53    |
|Thus when Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio Othello is the subject while the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio                                     |464.14    |
|And this kind of association is not confined to men in animals also it is very strong                                                                                 |463.94    |
|So long as we are dealing with derivative knowledge we have the test of intuitive knowledge to fall back upon                                                         |462.2     |
|Thus our principle states that if this implies that and this is true then that is true                                                                                |461.82    |
|And past sense-data which are remembered are known to have existed in the past                                                                                        |459.14    |
|It is common to think of relations as though they always held between two terms but in fact this is not always the case                                               |458.71    |
|But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future unless the inductive principle is assumed                                                                  |458.41    |
|Moreover the description required to express the thought will vary for different people or for the same person at different times                                     |457.19    |
|The chief objection to it is that it unduly limits knowledge                                                                                                          |455.82    |
|'Yes ' says the other ' I admit that '                                                                                                                                |455.2     |
|It is that we may sometimes know a general proposition in cases where we do not know a single instance of it                                                          |453.45    |
|Thus probability is all we ought to seek                                                                                                                              |453.0     |
|Many philosophers it is true have held that philosophy could establish the truth of certain answers to such fundamental questions                                     |452.9     |
|Thus a belief is true when there is a corresponding fact and is false when there is no corresponding fact                                                             |452.4     |
|It is therefore important to consider what kinds of things there are with which we have acquaintance                                                                  |449.53    |
|That which many different thoughts of whiteness have in common is their _object_ and this object is different from all of them                                        |449.41    |
|In the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons in my opinion fallacious which idealists advance in favour of their theory                             |448.0     |
|In these characteristics the principle of induction does not stand alone                                                                                              |447.82    |
|Thus the problems connected with knowledge of truths are more difficult than those connected with knowledge of things                                                 |447.06    |
|Thus acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of its 'nature ' in the above sense                                                                         |447.0     |
|In the next chapter we shall proceed to develop its nature and its bearing upon the questions with which we have been dealing                                         |445.83    |
|Thus universals are not thoughts though when known they are the objects of thoughts                                                                                   |444.43    |
|All this which is psychological we are not calling in question                                                                                                        |442.09    |
|The problem arises through the fact that such knowledge is general whereas all experience is particular                                                               |440.81    |
|The above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident logical principles                                                                              |439.93    |
|In this chapter we shall be concerned exclusively with knowledge of things of which in turn we shall have to distinguish two kinds                                    |439.87    |
|Hence we can never know any proposition of the form 'this is a physical object ' where 'this ' is something immediately known                                         |439.87    |
|Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance ' which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality ' behind                                                    |439.83    |
|If the above account is correct all our knowledge of truths depends upon our intuitive knowledge                                                                      |439.5     |
|In one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence of things other than ourselves and our experiences                                             |439.18    |
|What things are there in the universe whose existence is known to us owing to our being acquainted with them                                                          |438.85    |
|Hence he inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known _a priori_ about the connexion of cause and effect                                    |438.05    |
|By this is meant that whatever being belongs to them is independent of their being thought of or in any way apprehended by minds                                      |436.92    |
|Our immediate knowledge of things which we called _acquaintance_ consists of two sorts according as the things known are particulars or universals                    |434.86    |
|There is however a preliminary question which is rather less difficult and that is What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood                                           |434.23    |
|Thus ' a man ' is an ambiguous description and 'the man with the iron mask ' is a definite description                                                                |432.76    |
|if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind                                                                                                                       |432.22    |
|This question which at first sight might not seem difficult is really one of the most difficult that can be asked                                                     |432.1     |
|Now in order to know whether two propositions can both be true we must know such truths as the law of contradiction                                                   |431.5     |
|Take for instance the relation 'between '                                                                                                                             |430.0     |
|And no fact about the constitution of our minds could make it _true_ that two and two are four                                                                        |428.0     |
|This relation is something although we can not say that it exists _in the same sense_ in which I and my room exist                                                    |428.0     |
|One way of escape is by philosophic contemplation                                                                                                                     |428.0     |
|1 Our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite falsehood                                                                                              |427.93    |
|Thus coherence as the definition of truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one coherent system                                                  |426.24    |
|But any statement as to what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong                                                             |423.43    |
|These subjects will be dealt with in the following chapters                                                                                                           |422.6     |
|We are all convinced that the sun will rise to-morrow                                                                                                                 |422.1     |
|We will begin with the latter question                                                                                                                                |420.14    |
|Thus the greater part of what would commonly pass as knowledge is more or less probable opinion                                                                       |419.41    |
|But are we to say that nothing is knowledge except what is validly deduced from true premisses                                                                        |419.29    |
|Let us take in illustration the universal _whiteness_                                                                                                                 |418.12    |
|the objects apprehended must be mental are found to have no validity whatever                                                                                         |417.69    |
|For this reason the word 'innate ' would not now be employed to describe our knowledge of logical principles                                                          |416.47    |
|What we firmly believe if it is not true is called _error_                                                                                                            |414.25    |
|This applies in particular to such matters as the distinction between dreams and waking life                                                                          |413.93    |
|The other point is more interesting and of more philosophical importance                                                                                              |412.36    |
|The connected ambiguity in the word 'idea ' which we noted at the same time also causes confusion here                                                                |411.95    |
|The 'idea ' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just it is something other than particular things which particular things partake of                     |411.29    |
|But this is a large question to which we must return at a later stage                                                                                                 |410.93    |
|It has now become possible to decide with some confidence as to the truth or falsehood of these opposing schools                                                      |409.3     |
|A. is the Unionist candidate for this constituency ' means 'Mr                                                                                                        |408.91    |
|In the first place it is too wide because it is not enough that our premisses should be _true_ they must also be _known_                                              |407.75    |
|He gives the name 'idea ' to anything which is _immediately_ known as for example sense-data are known                                                                |407.67    |
|Assuming that there is physical space and that it does thus correspond to private spaces what can we know about it                                                    |406.95    |
|It can therefore at best define one sort of knowledge the sort we call derivative as opposed to intuitive knowledge                                                   |406.8     |
|In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges and there are terms concerning which it judges                                                                 |406.32    |
|It is necessary to prove generally that by being known things are shown to be mental                                                                                  |405.94    |
|It does not exist in Edinburgh any more than in London for it relates the two and is neutral as between them                                                          |403.82    |
|This question will occupy us in the present chapter                                                                                                                   |403.22    |
|They must all in some sense partake of a common nature which will be found in whatever is just and in nothing else                                                    |402.83    |
|His body as a physical object and still more his mind were only known as the body and the mind connected with these sense-data                                        |401.83    |
|the universals represented by adjectives and substantives whereas we can prove that there must be _relations_ i.e                                                     |400.0     |
|They have supposed that what is of most importance in religious beliefs could be proved by strict demonstration to be true                                            |399.86    |
|By a 'description ' I mean any phrase of the form ' a so-and-so ' or 'the so-and-so '                                                                                 |398.89    |
|Take for example a piece of reasoning in geometry                                                                                                                     |398.22    |
|This is a matter which is concerned exclusively with definite descriptions                                                                                            |398.09    |
|And if so have we any means of finding out what it is like                                                                                                            |397.86    |
|The collection of all physical objects is called 'matter '                                                                                                            |396.4     |
|Let us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us in fact feel the slightest doubt                                                                       |394.32    |
|Suppose it also known that this _is_ true then it follows that that is true '                                                                                         |394.12    |
|It is obvious that it is only what goes on in our own minds that can be thus known immediately                                                                        |393.85    |
|Thus the fact that a thing has relations does not prove that its relations are logically necessary                                                                    |393.53    |
|Thus relations as we shall see more fully in the next chapter must be placed in a world which is neither mental nor physical                                          |392.46    |
|Before the time of Kant it was generally held that whatever knowledge was _a priori_ must be 'analytic '                                                              |392.16    |
|It is often said as though it were a self-evident truism that we can not know that anything exists which we do not know                                               |391.25    |
|We have here the same ambiguity as we noted in discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV                                                                                      |390.53    |
|All our knowledge both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths rests upon acquaintance as its foundation                                                          |389.65    |
|derived from instances and not an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and arithmetic                                                          |387.37    |
|It would seem however that there are cases of very firm belief in a memory which is wholly false                                                                      |387.26    |
|A. is a Unionist candidate for this constituency and no one else is '                                                                                                 |386.5     |
|It is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance with the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition means                            |383.18    |
|In addition to general principles the other kind of self-evident truths are those immediately derived from sensation                                                  |382.53    |
|In this case if he made a judgement about himself he himself might be a constituent of the judgement                                                                  |382.11    |
|We may believe what is false as well as what is true                                                                                                                  |381.58    |
|The relation of resemblance therefore must be a true universal                                                                                                        |379.9     |
|Our immediate knowledge of _truths_ may be called _intuitive_ knowledge and the truths so known may be called _self-evident_ truths                                   |379.65    |
|2 If so what sort of object can it be                                                                                                                                 |379.3     |
|2 If so what sort of object can it be                                                                                                                                 |379.3     |
|Thus space and time appear to be infinite in extent                                                                                                                   |378.6     |
|This is again a judgement of perception but it differs from our previous kind                                                                                         |377.43    |
|It may be said of course that I judge this because of other people's acquaintance with him                                                                            |376.94    |
|Further we know the truth ' I am acquainted with this sense-datum '                                                                                                   |376.85    |
|This consideration will occupy the next chapter                                                                                                                       |374.14    |
|Our next chapter therefore will be concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at all                                                         |374.0     |
|Here all the words are abstract except 'German '                                                                                                                      |373.33    |
|It is felt by many that a belief for which no reason can be given is an unreasonable belief                                                                           |371.68    |
|Yet we feel when challenged that a perfectly good reason could be found even if we are not ready with it at the moment                                                |371.0     |
|Take for example the beliefs produced by reading                                                                                                                      |370.38    |
|Our derivative knowledge of things which we call knowledge by _description_ always involves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths                  |370.14    |
|Common sense unhesitatingly answers that there is                                                                                                                     |366.71    |
|We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading                                                                            |366.47    |
|But if a person who knew Bismarck made a judgement about him the case is different                                                                                    |366.38    |
|The question which must next occupy us is this How is it possible that there should be such knowledge                                                                 |366.32    |
|The essential characteristic of philosophy which makes it a study distinct from science is criticism                                                                  |365.73    |
|If then we can not trust what we see with the naked eye why should we trust what we see through a microscope                                                          |365.52    |
|We shall say that an object is 'known by description ' when we know that it is 'the so-and-so ' i.e                                                                   |364.81    |
|It should be noted that probability is always relative to certain data                                                                                                |362.83    |
|This however is a circular definition it assumes that we already know what is meant by 'known premisses '                                                             |362.68    |
|And the same holds for other logical principles                                                                                                                       |360.62    |
|Before Hume rationalists at least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the cause if only we had sufficient knowledge                          |359.87    |
|He fully admits that the tree must continue to exist even when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it                                                     |354.75    |
|If I am acquainted with a thing which exists my acquaintance gives me the knowledge that it exists                                                                    |353.72    |
|A similar process will make us acquainted with any other universal of the same sort                                                                                   |353.27    |
|And the same applies to less vivid experiences so long as they are recent                                                                                             |352.29    |
|In one way or another if our life is to be great and free we must escape this prison and this strife                                                                  |349.05    |
|This is what Berkeley believes himself to have done                                                                                                                   |348.22    |
|The view which led to their being so named is a natural one but there are strong reasons for thinking that it is erroneous                                            |348.12    |
|It is however very difficult and is differently understood by different philosophers                                                                                  |348.0     |
|The same thing is exemplified in geometry                                                                                                                             |347.86    |
|There is in fact no such object and therefore Othello can not have any relation to such an object                                                                     |347.05    |
|It should be observed that in all cases of general principles particular instances dealing with familiar things are more evident than the general principle           |345.92    |
|we can only answer by appealing to our principle                                                                                                                      |345.89    |
|Hence his grounds in favour of idealism may be dismissed                                                                                                              |344.4     |
|This principle is really involved at least concrete instances of it are involved in all demonstrations                                                                |342.94    |
|In this way I become acquainted with the universal relation                                                                                                           |342.8     |
|The word will be applicable to a number of particular things because they all participate in a common nature or essence                                               |342.24    |
|The mere fact that something has happened a certain number of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen again                                        |342.09    |
|But I do not believe that when all these things cease the table ceases                                                                                                |342.07    |
|But whether true or false idealism is not to be dismissed as obviously absurd                                                                                         |339.79    |
|Hence this knowledge though true of all actual and possible experience must not be supposed to apply outside experience                                               |336.0     |
|Yet obviously the word 'in ' has a meaning it denotes a relation which holds between me and my room                                                                   |335.1     |
|But we know that there is an object B called Bismarck and that B was an astute diplomatist                                                                            |334.67    |
|There will also be things remembered or imagined for with such things also we have immediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining                   |331.88    |
|Thus space and time appear to be infinitely divisible                                                                                                                 |331.22    |
|Now everything that can be apprehended by the senses or by introspection exists at some particular time                                                               |330.53    |
|A mind which believes believes truly when there is a _corresponding_ complex not involving the mind but only its objects                                              |329.75    |
|We shall not at this stage attempt to answer all the objections which may be urged against this fundamental principle                                                 |328.4     |
|It is neither in space nor in time neither material nor mental yet it is something                                                                                    |324.5     |
|The way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really are physical objects is easily seen                                                             |324.11    |
|with qualities which are exemplified in sense-data                                                                                                                    |322.29    |
|If this were so we should be involved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything that could be known _a priori_                                     |321.58    |
|Hence his belief can not possibly consist in a relation to this object                                                                                                |321.31    |
|The first extension beyond sense-data to be considered is acquaintance by _memory_                                                                                    |320.75    |
|I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in the same chair in which I am sitting now                                                              |319.95    |
|In derivative knowledge our ultimate premisses must have some degree of self-evidence and so must their connexion with the conclusions deduced from them              |319.7     |
|Also in memory I perceive that what I am remembering came before the present time                                                                                     |319.4     |
|On the other hand facts about universals do not have this privacy                                                                                                     |317.75    |
|Many minds may be acquainted with the same universals hence a relation between universals may be known by acquaintance to many different people                       |315.74    |
|It follows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that no actual instance can be given                                                            |315.28    |
|In this last description _Julius Caesar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted                                                                             |315.12    |
|And in this belief we are usually justified                                                                                                                           |315.0     |
|Also we can be forced to admit on reflection that there may be some doubt however slight as to whether _all_ men are mortal                                           |313.17    |
|Thus whatever self-evident truths may be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data from which they are obtained                                  |311.1     |
|It would seem that cases of fallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way i.e                                                                          |308.39    |
|Then _in one sense_ it may be said that whiteness is 'in our mind '                                                                                                   |302.33    |
|It is in this way that many scientific hypotheses acquire their probability                                                                                           |301.83    |
|Thus there is no dualism as regards acquaintance                                                                                                                      |301.12    |
|and 'What beliefs are false '                                                                                                                                         |298.5     |
|Thus all judgements as to what is useful depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account                                                               |296.8     |
|But we have already considered these reasons and decided that they are inadequate                                                                                     |296.0     |
|There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter exists and it is important to keep them clear                                                   |295.4     |
|Hence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this possibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given                               |293.81    |
|Now to this view there are two answers                                                                                                                                |292.75    |
|Such a definition is at once too wide and too narrow                                                                                                                  |289.0     |
|So far our answer has been that we are acquainted with our sense-data and probably with ourselves                                                                     |287.47    |
|Thus all truths involve universals and all knowledge of truths involves acquaintance with universals                                                                  |287.14    |
|This difficulty is no light one                                                                                                                                       |285.0     |
|But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle                                                                                          |284.07    |
|It must not be supposed that 'ideas ' in his sense exist in minds though they may be apprehended by minds                                                             |280.81    |
|This however we can now see to have been an error                                                                                                                     |280.09    |
|It might happen if Kant is right that to-morrow our nature would so change as to make two and two become five                                                         |279.5     |
|That is they were known by description                                                                                                                                |277.43    |
|Thus utility does not belong to philosophy                                                                                                                            |276.71    |
|The problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one since it was brought into philosophy by Plato                                                           |275.9     |
|Thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as well as concerning sense-data                                                                              |272.25    |
|All knowledge we find must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs and if these are rejected nothing is left                                                         |272.0     |
|But some care is needed in using Descartes ' argument                                                                                                                 |271.9     |
|There is however a great difficulty in this view or rather two great difficulties                                                                                     |266.71    |
|These things are known to us by what I call 'knowledge by description ' which we must now consider                                                                    |266.63    |
|all these are things of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching my table                                                                       |266.61    |
|Among particulars we have acquaintance with sense-data and probably with ourselves                                                                                    |264.36    |
|All knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent on experience                                                                                           |263.83    |
|In this way what seemed mysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon an error                                                               |263.75    |
|This is of course denied by many philosophers either for Berkeley 's reasons or for Kant 's                                                                           |263.47    |
|2 If so what is its nature                                                                                                                                            |262.0     |
|And what holds for colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data                                                                                      |262.0     |
|The word 'know ' is here used in two different senses                                                                                                                 |261.36    |
|To make clear what sort of reason there is let us consider for a moment what our acquaintance with particular thoughts really involves                                |256.83    |
|This view however seems open to objections similar to those which we urged before against Kant                                                                        |256.38    |
|If we can show that such statements as this really deal only with universals our proposition may be regarded as proved                                                |255.57    |
|The table is 'the physical object which causes such-and-such sense-data '                                                                                             |254.64    |
|The real table if it exists we will call a 'physical object '                                                                                                         |253.62    |
|Thus thoughts and feelings minds and physical objects exist                                                                                                           |252.89    |
|Hume argued correctly as would now be generally admitted that this could not be done                                                                                  |250.07    |
|Suppose for instance that I am in my room                                                                                                                             |250.0     |
|not 'What beliefs are true '                                                                                                                                          |248.67    |
|Hence it was supposed that ultimately there can be no such entities as relations between things                                                                       |247.44    |
|By applying this test it appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with particulars are really concerned only with universals                   |246.39    |
|This doctrine which is very widely held among philosophers has several forms and is advocated on several different grounds                                            |245.74    |
|In this belief they seem to have been mistaken                                                                                                                        |244.67    |
|What reason then have we for believing that there are such public neutral objects                                                                                     |243.79    |
|It remains to see whether there are any other grounds                                                                                                                 |243.7     |
|It will be remembered that we asked two questions namely 1 Is there a real table at all                                                                               |241.61    |
|Such judgements must in part at least be immediate and _a priori_                                                                                                     |240.5     |
|We can now see that in certain cases at least it does do so                                                                                                           |240.14    |
|It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one word which denotes a universal                                                                   |237.7     |
|They can be apprehended with less effort of abstraction than any others and they seem less removed from particulars than other universals are                         |236.0     |
|Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands for a universal since all verbs have a meaning which is universal                                 |232.13    |
|In other words can we ever _know_ anything at all or do we merely sometimes by good luck believe what is true                                                         |228.91    |
|Among these surprising possibilities doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all                                                                             |226.07    |
|If Othello loves Desdemona there is such a complex whole as 'Othello 's love for Desdemona '                                                                          |223.94    |
|Two propositions are coherent when both may be true and are incoherent when one at least must be false                                                                |222.63    |
|We can think _of_ a universal and our thinking then exists in a perfectly ordinary sense like any other mental act                                                    |217.48    |
|The chief difficulty in regard to knowledge however does not arise over derivative knowledge but over intuitive knowledge                                             |217.33    |
|In fact whatever else may be doubtful some at least of our immediate experiences seem absolutely certain                                                              |213.76    |
|Some at least of these principles must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible                                                                       |213.75    |
|Two opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general propositions                                                                                     |211.67    |
|Hence although our general proposition is _a priori_ all its applications to actual particulars involve experience and therefore contain an empirical element         |211.27    |
|Many universals like many particulars are only known to us by description                                                                                             |207.92    |
|Thus no fact about any particular existing thing can be self-evident to more than one person                                                                          |202.12    |

|Thus our two questions may be re-stated as follows 1 Is there any such thing as matter                                                                                |186.24    |
|All pure mathematics is _a priori_ like logic                                                                                                                         |188.25    |
|But these philosophers though they deny matter as opposed to mind nevertheless in another sense admit matter                                                          |188.35    |
|Let us consider say such a notion as _justice_                                                                                                                        |189.11    |
|' I think therefore I am ' says rather more than is strictly certain                                                                                                  |190.93    |
|This knowledge scarcely rises into consciousness except in a person who can not read easily                                                                           |193.4     |
|In this respect judging is exactly like every other relation                                                                                                          |197.6     |
|The same thing applies to general philosophical hypotheses                                                                                                            |199.5     |
|In each there are two kinds one immediate and one derivative                                                                                                          |200.73    |
|Thus no fact about any particular existing thing can be self-evident to more than one person                                                                          |202.12    |
|Many universals like many particulars are only known to us by description                                                                                             |207.92    |
|Hence although our general proposition is _a priori_ all its applications to actual particulars involve experience and therefore contain an empirical element         |211.27    |
|Two opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general propositions                                                                                     |211.67    |
|Some at least of these principles must be granted before any argument or proof becomes possible                                                                       |213.75    |
|In fact whatever else may be doubtful some at least of our immediate experiences seem absolutely certain                                                              |213.76    |
|The chief difficulty in regard to knowledge however does not arise over derivative knowledge but over intuitive knowledge                                             |217.33    |
|We can think _of_ a universal and our thinking then exists in a perfectly ordinary sense like any other mental act                                                    |217.48    |
|Two propositions are coherent when both may be true and are incoherent when one at least must be false                                                                |222.63    |
|If Othello loves Desdemona there is such a complex whole as 'Othello 's love for Desdemona '                                                                          |223.94    |
|Among these surprising possibilities doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all                                                                             |226.07    |
|In other words can we ever _know_ anything at all or do we merely sometimes by good luck believe what is true                                                         |228.91    |
|Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands for a universal since all verbs have a meaning which is universal                                 |232.13    |
|They can be apprehended with less effort of abstraction than any others and they seem less removed from particulars than other universals are                         |236.0     |
|It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one word which denotes a universal                                                                   |237.7     |
|We can now see that in certain cases at least it does do so                                                                                                           |240.14    |
|Such judgements must in part at least be immediate and _a priori_                                                                                                     |240.5     |
|It will be remembered that we asked two questions namely 1 Is there a real table at all                                                                               |241.61    |
|It remains to see whether there are any other grounds                                                                                                                 |243.7     |
|What reason then have we for believing that there are such public neutral objects                                                                                     |243.79    |
|In this belief they seem to have been mistaken                                                                                                                        |244.67    |
|This doctrine which is very widely held among philosophers has several forms and is advocated on several different grounds                                            |245.74    |
|By applying this test it appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with particulars are really concerned only with universals                   |246.39    |
|Hence it was supposed that ultimately there can be no such entities as relations between things                                                                       |247.44    |
|not 'What beliefs are true '                                                                                                                                          |248.67    |
|Suppose for instance that I am in my room                                                                                                                             |250.0     |
|Hume argued correctly as would now be generally admitted that this could not be done                                                                                  |250.07    |
|Thus thoughts and feelings minds and physical objects exist                                                                                                           |252.89    |
|The real table if it exists we will call a 'physical object '                                                                                                         |253.62    |
|The table is 'the physical object which causes such-and-such sense-data '                                                                                             |254.64    |
|If we can show that such statements as this really deal only with universals our proposition may be regarded as proved                                                |255.57    |
|This view however seems open to objections similar to those which we urged before against Kant                                                                        |256.38    |
|To make clear what sort of reason there is let us consider for a moment what our acquaintance with particular thoughts really involves                                |256.83    |
|The word 'know ' is here used in two different senses                                                                                                                 |261.36    |
|2 If so what is its nature                                                                                                                                            |262.0     |
|And what holds for colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data                                                                                      |262.0     |
|This is of course denied by many philosophers either for Berkeley 's reasons or for Kant 's                                                                           |263.47    |
|In this way what seemed mysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon an error                                                               |263.75    |
|All knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent on experience                                                                                           |263.83    |
|Among particulars we have acquaintance with sense-data and probably with ourselves                                                                                    |264.36    |
|all these are things of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching my table                                                                       |266.61    |
|These things are known to us by what I call 'knowledge by description ' which we must now consider                                                                    |266.63    |
|There is however a great difficulty in this view or rather two great difficulties                                                                                     |266.71    |
|But some care is needed in using Descartes ' argument                                                                                                                 |271.9     |
|All knowledge we find must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs and if these are rejected nothing is left                                                         |272.0     |
|Thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as well as concerning sense-data                                                                              |272.25    |
|The problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one since it was brought into philosophy by Plato                                                           |275.9     |
|Thus utility does not belong to philosophy                                                                                                                            |276.71    |
|That is they were known by description                                                                                                                                |277.43    |
|It might happen if Kant is right that to-morrow our nature would so change as to make two and two become five                                                         |279.5     |
|This however we can now see to have been an error                                                                                                                     |280.09    |
|It must not be supposed that 'ideas ' in his sense exist in minds though they may be apprehended by minds                                                             |280.81    |
|But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle                                                                                          |284.07    |
|This difficulty is no light one                                                                                                                                       |285.0     |
|Thus all truths involve universals and all knowledge of truths involves acquaintance with universals                                                                  |287.14    |
|So far our answer has been that we are acquainted with our sense-data and probably with ourselves                                                                     |287.47    |
|Such a definition is at once too wide and too narrow                                                                                                                  |289.0     |
|Now to this view there are two answers                                                                                                                                |292.75    |
|Hence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this possibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given                               |293.81    |
|There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter exists and it is important to keep them clear                                                   |295.4     |
|But we have already considered these reasons and decided that they are inadequate                                                                                     |296.0     |
|Thus all judgements as to what is useful depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account                                                               |296.8     |
|and 'What beliefs are false '                                                                                                                                         |298.5     |
|Thus there is no dualism as regards acquaintance                                                                                                                      |301.12    |
|It is in this way that many scientific hypotheses acquire their probability                                                                                           |301.83    |
|Then _in one sense_ it may be said that whiteness is 'in our mind '                                                                                                   |302.33    |
|It would seem that cases of fallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way i.e                                                                          |308.39    |
|Thus whatever self-evident truths may be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data from which they are obtained                                  |311.1     |
|Also we can be forced to admit on reflection that there may be some doubt however slight as to whether _all_ men are mortal                                           |313.17    |
|And in this belief we are usually justified                                                                                                                           |315.0     |
|In this last description _Julius Caesar_ is a noise or shape with which we are acquainted                                                                             |315.12    |
|It follows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that no actual instance can be given                                                            |315.28    |
|Many minds may be acquainted with the same universals hence a relation between universals may be known by acquaintance to many different people                       |315.74    |
|On the other hand facts about universals do not have this privacy                                                                                                     |317.75    |
|Also in memory I perceive that what I am remembering came before the present time                                                                                     |319.4     |
|In derivative knowledge our ultimate premisses must have some degree of self-evidence and so must their connexion with the conclusions deduced from them              |319.7     |
|I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in the same chair in which I am sitting now                                                              |319.95    |
|The first extension beyond sense-data to be considered is acquaintance by _memory_                                                                                    |320.75    |
|Hence his belief can not possibly consist in a relation to this object                                                                                                |321.31    |
|If this were so we should be involved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything that could be known _a priori_                                     |321.58    |
|with qualities which are exemplified in sense-data                                                                                                                    |322.29    |
|The way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really are physical objects is easily seen                                                             |324.11    |
|It is neither in space nor in time neither material nor mental yet it is something                                                                                    |324.5     |
|We shall not at this stage attempt to answer all the objections which may be urged against this fundamental principle                                                 |328.4     |
|A mind which believes believes truly when there is a _corresponding_ complex not involving the mind but only its objects                                              |329.75    |
|Now everything that can be apprehended by the senses or by introspection exists at some particular time                                                               |330.53    |
|Thus space and time appear to be infinitely divisible                                                                                                                 |331.22    |
|There will also be things remembered or imagined for with such things also we have immediate acquaintance at the moment of remembering or imagining                   |331.88    |
|But we know that there is an object B called Bismarck and that B was an astute diplomatist                                                                            |334.67    |
|Yet obviously the word 'in ' has a meaning it denotes a relation which holds between me and my room                                                                   |335.1     |
|Hence this knowledge though true of all actual and possible experience must not be supposed to apply outside experience                                               |336.0     |
|But whether true or false idealism is not to be dismissed as obviously absurd                                                                                         |339.79    |
|But I do not believe that when all these things cease the table ceases                                                                                                |342.07    |
|The mere fact that something has happened a certain number of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen again                                        |342.09    |
|The word will be applicable to a number of particular things because they all participate in a common nature or essence                                               |342.24    |
|In this way I become acquainted with the universal relation                                                                                                           |342.8     |
|This principle is really involved at least concrete instances of it are involved in all demonstrations                                                                |342.94    |
|Hence his grounds in favour of idealism may be dismissed                                                                                                              |344.4     |
|we can only answer by appealing to our principle                                                                                                                      |345.89    |
|It should be observed that in all cases of general principles particular instances dealing with familiar things are more evident than the general principle           |345.92    |
|There is in fact no such object and therefore Othello can not have any relation to such an object                                                                     |347.05    |
|The same thing is exemplified in geometry                                                                                                                             |347.86    |
|It is however very difficult and is differently understood by different philosophers                                                                                  |348.0     |
|The view which led to their being so named is a natural one but there are strong reasons for thinking that it is erroneous                                            |348.12    |
|This is what Berkeley believes himself to have done                                                                                                                   |348.22    |
|In one way or another if our life is to be great and free we must escape this prison and this strife                                                                  |349.05    |
|And the same applies to less vivid experiences so long as they are recent                                                                                             |352.29    |
|A similar process will make us acquainted with any other universal of the same sort                                                                                   |353.27    |
|If I am acquainted with a thing which exists my acquaintance gives me the knowledge that it exists                                                                    |353.72    |
|He fully admits that the tree must continue to exist even when we shut our eyes or when no human being is near it                                                     |354.75    |
|Before Hume rationalists at least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the cause if only we had sufficient knowledge                          |359.87    |
|And the same holds for other logical principles                                                                                                                       |360.62    |
|This however is a circular definition it assumes that we already know what is meant by 'known premisses '                                                             |362.68    |
|It should be noted that probability is always relative to certain data                                                                                                |362.83    |
|We shall say that an object is 'known by description ' when we know that it is 'the so-and-so ' i.e                                                                   |364.81    |
|If then we can not trust what we see with the naked eye why should we trust what we see through a microscope                                                          |365.52    |
|The essential characteristic of philosophy which makes it a study distinct from science is criticism                                                                  |365.73    |
|The question which must next occupy us is this How is it possible that there should be such knowledge                                                                 |366.32    |
|But if a person who knew Bismarck made a judgement about him the case is different                                                                                    |366.38    |
|We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading                                                                            |366.47    |
|Common sense unhesitatingly answers that there is                                                                                                                     |366.71    |
|Our derivative knowledge of things which we call knowledge by _description_ always involves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths                  |370.14    |
|Take for example the beliefs produced by reading                                                                                                                      |370.38    |
|Yet we feel when challenged that a perfectly good reason could be found even if we are not ready with it at the moment                                                |371.0     |
|It is felt by many that a belief for which no reason can be given is an unreasonable belief                                                                           |371.68    |
|Here all the words are abstract except 'German '                                                                                                                      |373.33    |
|Our next chapter therefore will be concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at all                                                         |374.0     |
|This consideration will occupy the next chapter                                                                                                                       |374.14    |
|Further we know the truth ' I am acquainted with this sense-datum '                                                                                                   |376.85    |
|It may be said of course that I judge this because of other people's acquaintance with him                                                                            |376.94    |
|This is again a judgement of perception but it differs from our previous kind                                                                                         |377.43    |
|Thus space and time appear to be infinite in extent                                                                                                                   |378.6     |
|2 If so what sort of object can it be                                                                                                                                 |379.3     |
|2 If so what sort of object can it be                                                                                                                                 |379.3     |
|Our immediate knowledge of _truths_ may be called _intuitive_ knowledge and the truths so known may be called _self-evident_ truths                                   |379.65    |
|The relation of resemblance therefore must be a true universal                                                                                                        |379.9     |
|We may believe what is false as well as what is true                                                                                                                  |381.58    |
|In this case if he made a judgement about himself he himself might be a constituent of the judgement                                                                  |382.11    |
|In addition to general principles the other kind of self-evident truths are those immediately derived from sensation                                                  |382.53    |
|It is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance with the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition means                            |383.18    |

|It would seem however that there are cases of very firm belief in a memory which is wholly false                                                                      |387.26    |
|derived from instances and not an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and arithmetic                                                          |387.37    |
|All our knowledge both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths rests upon acquaintance as its foundation                                                          |389.65    |
|We have here the same ambiguity as we noted in discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV                                                                                      |390.53    |
|It is often said as though it were a self-evident truism that we can not know that anything exists which we do not know                                               |391.25    |
|Before the time of Kant it was generally held that whatever knowledge was _a priori_ must be 'analytic '                                                              |392.16    |
|Thus relations as we shall see more fully in the next chapter must be placed in a world which is neither mental nor physical                                          |392.46    |
|Thus the fact that a thing has relations does not prove that its relations are logically necessary                                                                    |393.53    |
|It is obvious that it is only what goes on in our own minds that can be thus known immediately                                                                        |393.85    |
|Suppose it also known that this _is_ true then it follows that that is true '                                                                                         |394.12    |
|Let us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us in fact feel the slightest doubt                                                                       |394.32    |
|The collection of all physical objects is called 'matter '                                                                                                            |396.4     |
|And if so have we any means of finding out what it is like                                                                                                            |397.86    |
|This is a matter which is concerned exclusively with definite descriptions                                                                                            |398.09    |

|the universals represented by adjectives and substantives whereas we can prove that there must be _relations_ i.e                                                     |400.0     |
|His body as a physical object and still more his mind were only known as the body and the mind connected with these sense-data                                        |401.83    |
|They must all in some sense partake of a common nature which will be found in whatever is just and in nothing else                                                    |402.83    |
|This question will occupy us in the present chapter                                                                                                                   |403.22    |
|It does not exist in Edinburgh any more than in London for it relates the two and is neutral as between them                                                          |403.82    |
|It is necessary to prove generally that by being known things are shown to be mental                                                                                  |405.94    |
|In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges and there are terms concerning which it judges                                                                 |406.32    |
|It can therefore at best define one sort of knowledge the sort we call derivative as opposed to intuitive knowledge                                                   |406.8     |
|Assuming that there is physical space and that it does thus correspond to private spaces what can we know about it                                                    |406.95    |
|He gives the name 'idea ' to anything which is _immediately_ known as for example sense-data are known                                                                |407.67    |
|In the first place it is too wide because it is not enough that our premisses should be _true_ they must also be _known_                                              |407.75    |
|A. is the Unionist candidate for this constituency ' means 'Mr                                                                                                        |408.91    |
|It has now become possible to decide with some confidence as to the truth or falsehood of these opposing schools                                                      |409.3     |
|But this is a large question to which we must return at a later stage                                                                                                 |410.93    |
|The 'idea ' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just it is something other than particular things which particular things partake of                     |411.29    |
|The connected ambiguity in the word 'idea ' which we noted at the same time also causes confusion here                                                                |411.95    |
|The other point is more interesting and of more philosophical importance                                                                                              |412.36    |
|This applies in particular to such matters as the distinction between dreams and waking life                                                                          |413.93    |
|What we firmly believe if it is not true is called _error_                                                                                                            |414.25    |
|For this reason the word 'innate ' would not now be employed to describe our knowledge of logical principles                                                          |416.47    |
|the objects apprehended must be mental are found to have no validity whatever                                                                                         |417.69    |
|Let us take in illustration the universal _whiteness_                                                                                                                 |418.12    |
|But are we to say that nothing is knowledge except what is validly deduced from true premisses                                                                        |419.29    |
|Thus the greater part of what would commonly pass as knowledge is more or less probable opinion                                                                       |419.41    |
|We will begin with the latter question                                                                                                                                |420.14    |
|We are all convinced that the sun will rise to-morrow                                                                                                                 |422.1     |
|These subjects will be dealt with in the following chapters                                                                                                           |422.6     |
|But any statement as to what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong                                                             |423.43    |
|Thus coherence as the definition of truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one coherent system                                                  |426.24    |
|1 Our theory of truth must be such as to admit of its opposite falsehood                                                                                              |427.93    |
|And no fact about the constitution of our minds could make it _true_ that two and two are four                                                                        |428.0     |
|This relation is something although we can not say that it exists _in the same sense_ in which I and my room exist                                                    |428.0     |
|One way of escape is by philosophic contemplation                                                                                                                     |428.0     |
|Take for instance the relation 'between '                                                                                                                             |430.0     |
|Now in order to know whether two propositions can both be true we must know such truths as the law of contradiction                                                   |431.5     |
|This question which at first sight might not seem difficult is really one of the most difficult that can be asked                                                     |432.1     |
|if we mean merely being apprehended by the mind                                                                                                                       |432.22    |
|Thus ' a man ' is an ambiguous description and 'the man with the iron mask ' is a definite description                                                                |432.76    |
|There is however a preliminary question which is rather less difficult and that is What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood                                           |434.23    |
|Our immediate knowledge of things which we called _acquaintance_ consists of two sorts according as the things known are particulars or universals                    |434.86    |
|By this is meant that whatever being belongs to them is independent of their being thought of or in any way apprehended by minds                                      |436.92    |
|Hence he inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known _a priori_ about the connexion of cause and effect                                    |438.05    |
|What things are there in the universe whose existence is known to us owing to our being acquainted with them                                                          |438.85    |
|In one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence of things other than ourselves and our experiences                                             |439.18    |
|If the above account is correct all our knowledge of truths depends upon our intuitive knowledge                                                                      |439.5     |
|Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance ' which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality ' behind                                                    |439.83    |
|In this chapter we shall be concerned exclusively with knowledge of things of which in turn we shall have to distinguish two kinds                                    |439.87    |
|Hence we can never know any proposition of the form 'this is a physical object ' where 'this ' is something immediately known                                         |439.87    |
|The above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident logical principles                                                                              |439.93    |
|The problem arises through the fact that such knowledge is general whereas all experience is particular                                                               |440.81    |
|All this which is psychological we are not calling in question                                                                                                        |442.09    |
|Thus universals are not thoughts though when known they are the objects of thoughts                                                                                   |444.43    |
|In the next chapter we shall proceed to develop its nature and its bearing upon the questions with which we have been dealing                                         |445.83    |
|Thus acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of its 'nature ' in the above sense                                                                         |447.0     |
|Thus the problems connected with knowledge of truths are more difficult than those connected with knowledge of things                                                 |447.06    |
|In these characteristics the principle of induction does not stand alone                                                                                              |447.82    |
|In the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons in my opinion fallacious which idealists advance in favour of their theory                             |448.0     |
|That which many different thoughts of whiteness have in common is their _object_ and this object is different from all of them                                        |449.41    |
|It is therefore important to consider what kinds of things there are with which we have acquaintance                                                                  |449.53    |
|Thus a belief is true when there is a corresponding fact and is false when there is no corresponding fact                                                             |452.4     |
|Many philosophers it is true have held that philosophy could establish the truth of certain answers to such fundamental questions                                     |452.9     |
|Thus probability is all we ought to seek                                                                                                                              |453.0     |
|It is that we may sometimes know a general proposition in cases where we do not know a single instance of it                                                          |453.45    |
|'Yes ' says the other ' I admit that '                                                                                                                                |455.2     |
|The chief objection to it is that it unduly limits knowledge                                                                                                          |455.82    |
|Moreover the description required to express the thought will vary for different people or for the same person at different times                                     |457.19    |
|But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future unless the inductive principle is assumed                                                                  |458.41    |
|It is common to think of relations as though they always held between two terms but in fact this is not always the case                                               |458.71    |
|And past sense-data which are remembered are known to have existed in the past                                                                                        |459.14    |
|Thus our principle states that if this implies that and this is true then that is true                                                                                |461.82    |
|So long as we are dealing with derivative knowledge we have the test of intuitive knowledge to fall back upon                                                         |462.2     |
|And this kind of association is not confined to men in animals also it is very strong                                                                                 |463.94    |
|Thus when Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio Othello is the subject while the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio                                     |464.14    |
|The value of philosophy is in fact to be sought largely in its very uncertainty                                                                                       |464.53    |
|Of course similar things happen in dreams where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people                                                                   |464.78    |
|But if we mean this we shall have to admit that what _in this sense_ is in the mind may nevertheless be not mental                                                    |465.12    |
|Another relation with which we become acquainted in much the same way is resemblance                                                                                  |465.86    |
|But if the reality is not what appears have we any means of knowing whether there is any reality at all                                                               |471.71    |
|This property of having a 'sense ' or 'direction ' is one which the relation of judging shares with all other relations                                               |472.09    |
|The mental act is undoubtedly mental but is there any reason to suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense mental                                             |472.36    |
|For example the law of contradiction states that nothing can both have a certain property and not have it                                                             |473.26    |
|Our nature is as much a fact of the existing world as anything and there can be no certainty that it will remain constant                                             |476.38    |
|It will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple terms of which the meaning is definite and clear                                                  |476.5     |
|Suppose for example that we are thinking of whiteness                                                                                                                 |477.22    |
|These physical objects are in the space of science which we may call 'physical ' space                                                                                |478.19    |
|When what we believe is true it might be supposed that we had achieved a knowledge of what we believe                                                                 |478.55    |
|Thus it is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief                                                                           |479.05    |
|Again different people see the same object as of different shapes according to their point of view                                                                    |479.47    |
|The question remains whether there is any other method of discovering the intrinsic nature of physical objects                                                        |481.94    |
|When we say 'the so-and-so exists ' we mean that there is just one object which is the so-and-so                                                                      |482.89    |
|They are called 'analytic ' because the predicate is obtained by merely analysing the subject                                                                         |483.2     |
|But we can not hope to be acquainted directly with the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red                                                 |483.26    |
|The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the theory that truth consists in _coherence_                                                              |484.56    |
|But if it does correspond in the sense explained in the preceding chapter then it _must_ be true                                                                      |484.83    |
|We do not believe it because we see a connexion between the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_                                                                |488.61    |
|The interesting doubt is as to whether the laws of motion will remain in operation until to-morrow                                                                    |489.47    |
|We are not only aware of things but we are often aware of being aware of them                                                                                         |490.06    |
|We can know _only_ what is required in order to secure the correspondence                                                                                             |493.69    |
|It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a 'sense ' or 'direction '                                                                        |494.89    |
|Kant 's solution of the problem though not valid in my opinion is interesting                                                                                         |494.93    |
|To assert this is certainly within the scope of what we mean when we state that two and two are four                                                                  |495.0     |
|How are we to know in a given case that our belief is not erroneous                                                                                                   |497.47    |
|In order to understand his argument it is necessary to understand his use of the word 'idea '                                                                         |497.94    |
|Thus this sort of self-evidence is an absolute guarantee of truth                                                                                                     |498.0     |
|Let us take as an illustration the law of contradiction                                                                                                               |498.8     |
|The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic                                                             |500.68    |
|The one thing we know about it is that it is not what it seems                                                                                                        |500.87    |
|If we believe that there is such a universal we shall say that things are white because they have the quality of whiteness                                            |501.48    |
|It is this preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter                                                                                             |502.38    |
|There is no place or time where we can find the relation 'north of '                                                                                                  |502.4     |
|But as regards knowledge of truths there is a dualism                                                                                                                 |502.4     |
|But first of all we must examine our knowledge of universals                                                                                                          |502.64    |
|But then the resemblance required will have to be a universal                                                                                                         |502.82    |
|This sort of knowledge may be described as knowledge of _truths_                                                                                                      |503.09    |
|In this case it might seem as though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property rather than with the property                                        |503.43    |
|Let us consider first the knowledge of universals by acquaintance                                                                                                     |505.2     |
|But the 'real ' shape is not what we see it is something inferred from what we see                                                                                    |506.83    |
|A particular patch of colour which I see for example simply exists it is not the sort of thing that is true or false                                                  |512.08    |
|Similarly we may be aware of our feeling pleasure or pain and generally of the events which happen in our minds                                                       |514.57    |
|Its truth is just as indubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two other phenomena make four phenomena                                         |516.09    |
|_A priori_ knowledge is not all of the logical kind we have been hitherto considering                                                                                 |516.27    |
|an act of thought and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental                                                                                                  |516.43    |
|If this doubt is raised we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about the sunrise was first raised                                                   |518.41    |
|In our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour and shape the colour is red and the shape is round                                             |519.5     |
|The belief in the law of contradiction is a belief about things not only about thoughts                                                                               |520.62    |
|It is usually through particular instances that we come to be able to see the general principle                                                                       |521.0     |
|It is this question and not our previous question as to the difference between sense-data and the physical object that must now concern us                            |522.25    |
|We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles commonly called 'laws of thought '                                                                             |522.53    |
|For the probability that Socrates is mortal is greater on our data than the probability that all men are mortal                                                       |523.45    |
|We have a firm belief that it will rise in the future because it has risen in the past                                                                                |526.74    |
|Thus whenever we see a colour we have a sensation _of_ the colour but the colour itself is a sense-datum not a sensation                                              |528.7     |
|This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects                                                          |532.47    |
|Thus there must be intuitive judgements of memory and it is upon them ultimately that all our knowledge of the past depends                                           |534.23    |
|The chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience                                            |534.48    |
|Here we have a relation between two places and it seems plain that the relation subsists independently of our knowledge of it                                         |537.36    |
|We can not therefore include as part of the value of philosophy any definite set of answers to such questions                                                         |537.45    |
|Hence the relation 'north of ' is radically different from such things                                                                                                |537.58    |
|In like manner I become aware of the relation of before and after in time                                                                                             |539.07    |
|But knowledge of truths raises a further problem which does not arise in regard to knowledge of things namely the problem of _error_                                  |541.87    |
|the sort of universals generally represented by verbs and prepositions                                                                                                |543.7     |
|they can be shown to be not cases of memory in the strict sense at all                                                                                                |547.0     |
|Thus the scope and power of _a priori_ principles is strictly limited                                                                                                 |549.25    |
|The world of universals therefore may also be described as the world of being                                                                                         |551.21    |
|Thus a description will mean any phrase of the form 'the so-and-so ' in the singular                                                                                  |552.25    |
|Such cases are common in the experience of every mathematician                                                                                                        |552.7     |
|1 Kant 's 'thing in itself ' is identical in _definition_ with the physical object namely it is the cause of sensations                                               |553.59    |
|not analytic in all these propositions no analysis of the subject will reveal the predicate                                                                           |555.47    |
|Similarly if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello the constituents of the judgement are still the same but their order is different                             |556.91    |
|Hegel 's philosophy is very difficult and commentators differ as to the true interpretation of it                                                                     |557.0     |
|When it is said that light _is_ waves what is really meant is that waves are the physical cause of our sensations of light                                            |561.75    |
|It seems plain that it is not thought which produces the truth of the proposition ' I am in my room '                                                                 |562.73    |
|This is a question of the very greatest difficulty to which no completely satisfactory answer is possible                                                             |566.18    |
|In this chapter we have to see why this is the case                                                                                                                   |566.33    |
|But I perceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts and some parts are above other parts                                                        |569.57    |
|We can give instances of the associated sense-data but we can not give instances of the actual physical objects                                                       |569.63    |
|We have first to distinguish knowledge of things and knowledge of truths                                                                                              |569.67    |
|But for the sake of illustration let us assume that we think of him as 'the first Chancellor of the German Empire '                                                   |573.87    |
|we have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either of the outer senses or of the inner sense                                                      |574.57    |
|Yet it would be absurd to say that the reader does not _know_ that the newspaper announces the King 's death                                                          |575.05    |
|The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex and we subject it to some degree of analysis                                                                |575.55    |
|But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind is unreasonable                                                                                           |577.14    |
|In the main this view is just                                                                                                                                         |584.57    |
|to what we have called the 'physical object ' the other due to our own nature                                                                                         |586.5     |
|Yet the knowledge of such general propositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally admitted to be known                                               |594.64    |
|When a belief is true we said there is a corresponding fact in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex                                          |600.33    |
|2 In the second use of the word 'know ' above the word applies to our knowledge of _things_ which we may call _acquaintance_                                          |602.29    |
|The cement is the relation 'believing '                                                                                                                               |603.29    |
|In such a case we say that our knowledge of the object is knowledge by description                                                                                    |603.75    |
|The reference to the future in this question is not essential                                                                                                         |603.91    |
|This kind of acquaintance which may be called self-consciousness is the source of all our knowledge of mental things                                                  |605.11    |
|An example of such principles perhaps the most important example is the inductive principle which we considered in the preceding chapter                              |607.71    |
|But in spite of the truth of their belief they can not be said to have knowledge                                                                                      |609.76    |
|There is a confusion when this use of the word 'nature ' is employed between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths                                              |613.77    |
|There is no difficulty in supposing this to be the case                                                                                                               |614.73    |
|We may now take a survey of the sources of our knowledge as they have appeared in the course of our analysis                                                          |622.82    |
|The only thing constant so long as the name is rightly used is the object to which the name applies                                                                   |624.9     |
|In our case the data are merely the known cases of coexistence of A and B                                                                                             |642.06    |
|This essential incompleteness appears according to Hegel equally in the world of thought and in the world of things                                                   |648.95    |
|My knowledge of the table as a physical object on the contrary is not direct knowledge                                                                                |656.38    |
|On the other hand when a belief is _false_ there is no such complex unity composed only of the objects of the belief                                                  |656.65    |
|As the first of the problems connected with knowledge of truths let us examine the nature and scope of our intuitive judgements                                       |656.91    |
|such that the opposite would be self-contradictory and secondly for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of knowledge                       |660.29    |
|This world is of great importance to philosophy and in particular to the problems of _a priori_ knowledge                                                             |661.44    |
|The colour is that _of_ which we are immediately aware and the awareness itself is the sensation                                                                      |668.41    |
|to the things apprehended by our acts of apprehension                                                                                                                 |671.44    |
|Thus we have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects                                                                                               |674.42    |
|The real space is public the apparent space is private to the percipient                                                                                              |678.38    |
|There is another point of great importance in which the empiricists were in the right as against the rationalists                                                     |683.05    |
|This is the kind of criticism which constitutes philosophy                                                                                                            |685.44    |
|This constitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search of                                                                                      |686.93    |
|This is the sense in which we know sense-data                                                                                                                         |700.11    |
|This relation therefore is a relation of four terms since Othello also is one of the terms of the relation                                                            |701.65    |
|There is a similar hierarchy in the region of universals                                                                                                              |702.1     |
|My knowledge of the table is of the kind which we shall call 'knowledge by description '                                                                              |709.94    |
|The essence of the sort of entity that Plato meant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in sensation                                         |712.42    |
|In the strict sense it is not whiteness that is in our mind but the act of thinking of whiteness                                                                      |720.65    |
|The shape of the table is no better                                                                                                                                   |727.25    |
|Thus a problem arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table supposing there is such a thing                                                          |730.67    |
|Such as it is it is obtained through acquaintance with the sense-data that make up the appearance of the table                                                        |732.1     |
|In this therefore which was the most important point of the controversy the rationalists were in the right                                                            |732.33    |
|In the empirical case the evidence consists in the particular instances                                                                                               |737.18    |
|But the notion of being 'in ' the mind is ambiguous                                                                                                                   |755.27    |
|This is however only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of philosophy                                                                                     |761.29    |
|This question is of the greatest importance                                                                                                                           |791.43    |
|But the conclusion that the law of contradiction is a law of _thought_ is nevertheless erroneous                                                                      |793.88    |
|the sense-datum as the mark of some physical object                                                                                                                   |811.67    |

|Thus we have to consider the relation of sense-data to physical objects                                                                                               |1.7060012480692423e-42|
|Thus the scope and power of _a priori_ principles is strictly limited                                                                                                 |1.7060012480692423e-42|
|Thus there is immediate knowledge concerning universals as well as concerning sense-data                                                                              |1.7060012480692423e-42|
|In this chapter we have to see why this is the case                                                                                                                   |1.5739278210989656e-42|
|We have first to distinguish knowledge of things and knowledge of truths                                                                                              |1.559213494331678e-42|
|We may believe what is false as well as what is true                                                                                                                  |1.559213494331678e-42|
|Hence the relation 'north of ' is radically different from such things                                                                                                |5.3970875011108045e-43|
|What we firmly believe if it is not true is called _error_                                                                                                            |3.250731315697954e-43|
|All knowledge that something exists must be in part dependent on experience                                                                                           |2.942757872404068e-43|
|Such judgements must in part at least be immediate and _a priori_                                                                                                     |2.788643889003698e-43|
|On the other hand facts about universals do not have this privacy                                                                                                     |1.2428210334049636e-43|
|Many universals like many particulars are only known to us by description                                                                                             |7.774074061594497e-44|
|Two opposite points are to be observed concerning _a priori_ general propositions                                                                                     |6.220979177165329e-44|
|the objects apprehended must be mental are found to have no validity whatever                                                                                         |6.113094299271527e-45|
|The real table if it exists we will call a 'physical object '                                                                                                         |7.192865842535987e-46|
|The real space is public the apparent space is private to the percipient                                                                                              |7.192865842535987e-46|
|But we have already considered these reasons and decided that they are inadequate                                                                                     |5.004939447989671e-46|
|It is this preliminary question which is to be considered in this chapter                                                                                             |4.964561887715083e-46|
|We can know _only_ what is required in order to secure the correspondence                                                                                             |4.3155646120445e-46|
|Hence his belief can not possibly consist in a relation to this object                                                                                                |1.4937967066456695e-46|
|Further we know the truth ' I am acquainted with this sense-datum '                                                                                                   |1.2917312600205704e-47|
|' I think therefore I am ' says rather more than is strictly certain                                                                                                  |3.516190052971109e-49|
|The above principle is merely one of a certain number of self-evident logical principles                                                                              |1.990829184205919e-49|
|The world of universals therefore may also be described as the world of being                                                                                         |1.990829184205919e-49|
|an act of thought and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental                                                                                                  |1.552177309511389e-49|
|But I do not believe that when all these things cease the table ceases                                                                                                |1.3852586349265626e-49|
|But whether true or false idealism is not to be dismissed as obviously absurd                                                                                         |1.3852586349265626e-49|
|But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle                                                                                          |1.3852586349265626e-49|
|But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind is unreasonable                                                                                           |1.3852586349265626e-49|
|Thus all truths involve universals and all knowledge of truths involves acquaintance with universals                                                                  |1.306903200193938e-49|
|Thus universals are not thoughts though when known they are the objects of thoughts                                                                                   |1.306903200193938e-49|
|We can now see that in certain cases at least it does do so                                                                                                           |1.194454639370191e-49|
|This is again a judgement of perception but it differs from our previous kind                                                                                         |1.0132723137390654e-49|
|This constitutes the definition of truth and falsehood that we were in search of                                                                                      |1.0132723137390654e-49|
|This is however only a part of the truth concerning the uncertainty of philosophy                                                                                     |1.0132723137390654e-49|
|There is however a great difficulty in this view or rather two great difficulties                                                                                     |3.313964888170469e-50|
|Kant 's solution of the problem though not valid in my opinion is interesting                                                                                         |3.0789448383771824e-50|
|And if so have we any means of finding out what it is like                                                                                                            |2.7259298529930415e-50|
|And what holds for colours is closely similar to what holds for other sense-data                                                                                      |2.7259298529930415e-50|
|And past sense-data which are remembered are known to have existed in the past                                                                                        |2.7259298529930415e-50|
|And the same applies to less vivid experiences so long as they are recent                                                                                             |2.7259298529930415e-50|
|What reason then have we for believing that there are such public neutral objects                                                                                     |2.4902626327292554e-50|
|They did not prove that the colour is in the mind of the percipient                                                                                                   |1.426541177027023e-50|
|Among these surprising possibilities doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all                                                                             |7.14453458477879e-51|

|The essential characteristic of philosophy which makes it a study distinct from science is criticism                                                                  |5.510183183520396e-53|
|The value of philosophy is in fact to be sought largely in its very uncertainty                                                                                       |5.510183183520396e-53|
|But this is a large question to which we must return at a later stage                                                                                                 |3.834095308404546e-53|

|We noted in the preceding chapter the three principles commonly called 'laws of thought '                                                                             |3.3059912520625267e-53|

|This affords a fresh illustration of the necessity of distinguishing between sense-data and physical objects                                                          |2.804517890227139e-53|

|The colour is that _of_ which we are immediately aware and the awareness itself is the sensation                                                                      |4.221143474746945e-60|

|But these philosophers though they deny matter as opposed to mind nevertheless in another sense admit matter                                                          |2.9371557811422477e-60|
|But this affords no evidence for their truth in the future unless the inductive principle is assumed                                                                  |2.9371557811422477e-60|

|But are we to say that nothing is knowledge except what is validly deduced from true premisses                                                                        |2.9371557811422477e-60|
|It may be said of course that I judge this because of other people's acquaintance with him                                                                            |2.9134601528891307e-60|
|It is therefore important to consider what kinds of things there are with which we have acquaintance                                                                  |2.9134601528891307e-60|
|It is usually through particular instances that we come to be able to see the general principle                                                                       |2.9134601528891307e-60|
|Thus our two questions may be re-stated as follows 1 Is there any such thing as matter                                                                                |2.7710192111860945e-60|
|Thus our principle states that if this implies that and this is true then that is true                                                                                |2.7710192111860945e-60|
|Thus the greater part of what would commonly pass as knowledge is more or less probable opinion                                                                       |2.7710192111860945e-60|
|Thus acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of its 'nature ' in the above sense                                                                         |2.7710192111860945e-60|
|Thus the fact that a thing has relations does not prove that its relations are logically necessary                                                                    |2.7710192111860945e-60|
|In fact whatever else may be doubtful some at least of our immediate experiences seem absolutely certain                                                              |2.5564953332956097e-60|
|In addition to general principles the other kind of self-evident truths are those immediately derived from sensation                                                  |2.5564953332956097e-60|
|We are not only aware of things but we are often aware of being aware of them                                                                                         |2.5325951853924534e-60|
|We may therefore sum up as follows what has been said concerning acquaintance with things that exist                                                                  |2.5325951853924534e-60|
|This is of course denied by many philosophers either for Berkeley 's reasons or for Kant 's                                                                           |2.148435360107214e-60|
|This is a question of the very greatest difficulty to which no completely satisfactory answer is possible                                                             |2.148435360107214e-60|

|Hence two very difficult questions at once arise namely 1 Is there a real table at all                                                                                |8.766367062718226e-61|
|And this kind of association is not confined to men in animals also it is very strong                                                                                 |5.779773123111556e-61|
|All our knowledge both knowledge of things and knowledge of truths rests upon acquaintance as its foundation                                                          |4.779855001588969e-61|
|Now everything that can be apprehended by the senses or by introspection exists at some particular time                                                               |3.777731381039038e-61|
|So far our answer has been that we are acquainted with our sense-data and probably with ourselves                                                                     |2.270394651040363e-61|

|My knowledge of the table is of the kind which we shall call 'knowledge by description '                                                                              |7.580543136392024e-62|
|all these are things of which I am immediately conscious when I am seeing and touching my table                                                                       |1.2254935448540093e-63|
|The way in which simplicity comes in from supposing that there really are physical objects is easily seen                                                             |1.1683209174500263e-63|
|The most important attempt at a definition of this sort is the theory that truth consists in _coherence_                                                              |1.1683209174500263e-63|
|The chief difficulty in regard to knowledge however does not arise over derivative knowledge but over intuitive knowledge                                             |1.1683209174500263e-63|
|But the 'real ' shape is not what we see it is something inferred from what we see                                                                                    |8.129409856468994e-64|
|But we know that there is an object B called Bismarck and that B was an astute diplomatist                                                                            |8.129409856468994e-64|
|But if it does correspond in the sense explained in the preceding chapter then it _must_ be true                                                                      |8.129409856468994e-64|
|It will be remembered that we asked two questions namely 1 Is there a real table at all                                                                               |8.06382549927797e-64|
|It follows that all our knowledge concerning physical objects is such that no actual instance can be given                                                            |8.06382549927797e-64|
|It would seem that cases of fallacious memory can probably all be dealt with in this way i.e                                                                          |8.06382549927797e-64|
|Thus the problems connected with knowledge of truths are more difficult than those connected with knowledge of things                                                 |7.6695798815004e-64|
|In order to understand his argument it is necessary to understand his use of the word 'idea '                                                                         |7.075824337934154e-64|
|In this therefore which was the most important point of the controversy the rationalists were in the right                                                            |7.075824337934154e-64|
|We do not believe it because we see a connexion between the universal _man_ and the universal _mortal_                                                                |7.009673914731396e-64|
|This world is of great importance to philosophy and in particular to the problems of _a priori_ knowledge                                                             |5.94640287879107e-64|
|If I am acquainted with a thing which exists my acquaintance gives me the knowledge that it exists                                                                    |4.4017348689651495e-64|
|He gives the name 'idea ' to anything which is _immediately_ known as for example sense-data are known                                                                |9.761569364331495e-65|
|Of course similar things happen in dreams where we are mistaken as to the existence of other people                                                                   |2.796732815665771e-65|
|Whatever he could bring himself to doubt he would doubt until he saw reason for not doubting it                                                                       |2.098129846773325e-65|
|The question which must next occupy us is this How is it possible that there should be such knowledge                                                                 |3.2336587806532695e-67|
|The thing to be accounted for is our certainty that the facts must always conform to logic and arithmetic                                                             |3.2336587806532695e-67|
|The connected ambiguity in the word 'idea ' which we noted at the same time also causes confusion here                                                                |3.2336587806532695e-67|
|It is felt by many that a belief for which no reason can be given is an unreasonable belief                                                                           |2.2318919178737805e-67|
|It would seem however that there are cases of very firm belief in a memory which is wholly false                                                                      |2.2318919178737805e-67|
|It will be observed that the relation of judging has what is called a 'sense ' or 'direction '                                                                        |2.2318919178737805e-67|
|Thus it is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief                                                                           |2.122773285773706e-67|
|In this case if he made a judgement about himself he himself might be a constituent of the judgement                                                                  |1.958434635464753e-67|
|In every act of judgement there is a mind which judges and there are terms concerning which it judges                                                                 |1.958434635464753e-67|
|We have a firm belief that it will rise in the future because it has risen in the past                                                                                |1.9401256337479642e-67|
|We can give instances of the associated sense-data but we can not give instances of the actual physical objects                                                       |1.9401256337479642e-67|
|This doctrine which is very widely held among philosophers has several forms and is advocated on several different grounds                                            |1.6458352833631524e-67|
|This kind of acquaintance which may be called self-consciousness is the source of all our knowledge of mental things                                                  |1.6458352833631524e-67|
|This however is a circular definition it assumes that we already know what is meant by 'known premisses '                                                             |1.6458352833631524e-67|
|This essential incompleteness appears according to Hegel equally in the world of thought and in the world of things                                                   |1.6458352833631524e-67|
|When we say 'the so-and-so exists ' we mean that there is just one object which is the so-and-so                                                                      |7.664444251186937e-68|
|Hence this knowledge though true of all actual and possible experience must not be supposed to apply outside experience                                               |6.71558311068491e-68|
|A very precise definition therefore should not be sought since any such definition must be more or less misleading                                                    |6.71558311068491e-68|
|There is another point of great importance in which the empiricists were in the right as against the rationalists                                                     |5.382798154872059e-68|
|There is in fact no such object and therefore Othello can not have any relation to such an object                                                                     |5.382798154872059e-68|
|And no fact about the constitution of our minds could make it _true_ that two and two are four                                                                        |4.4276661576526715e-68|
|For this reason the word 'innate ' would not now be employed to describe our knowledge of logical principles                                                          |4.04487722620444e-68|
|For example the law of contradiction states that nothing can both have a certain property and not have it                                                             |4.04487722620444e-68|
|derived from instances and not an _a priori_ connexion of universals such as we have in logic and arithmetic                                                          |3.2780335966567242e-68|
|These things are known to us by what I call 'knowledge by description ' which we must now consider                                                                    |2.3170985434879724e-68|
|By a 'description ' I mean any phrase of the form ' a so-and-so ' or 'the so-and-so '                                                                                 |1.931981667955185e-68|
|Let us take as an illustration a matter about which none of us in fact feel the slightest doubt                                                                       |1.7392636954433334e-68|
|Before the time of Kant it was generally held that whatever knowledge was _a priori_ must be 'analytic '                                                              |1.5464392489135204e-68|
|Two propositions are coherent when both may be true and are incoherent when one at least must be false                                                                |7.740749558997429e-69|
|The only thing constant so long as the name is rightly used is the object to which the name applies                                                                   |8.950065819687986e-71|
|The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex and we subject it to some degree of analysis                                                                |8.950065819687986e-71|
|It is obvious that it is only what goes on in our own minds that can be thus known immediately                                                                        |6.17739252110097e-71|
|It has now become possible to decide with some confidence as to the truth or falsehood of these opposing schools                                                      |6.17739252110097e-71|
|It will be seen that no sentence can be made up without at least one word which denotes a universal                                                                   |6.17739252110097e-71|
|It can therefore at best define one sort of knowledge the sort we call derivative as opposed to intuitive knowledge                                                   |6.17739252110097e-71|
|Thus all judgements as to what is useful depend upon judgements as to what has value on its own account                                                               |5.8753758255568945e-71|
|Thus a belief is true when there is a corresponding fact and is false when there is no corresponding fact                                                             |5.8753758255568945e-71|
|In the strict sense it is not whiteness that is in our mind but the act of thinking of whiteness                                                                      |5.420522102033637e-71|
|In this way what seemed mysterious in our _a priori_ knowledge is seen to have been based upon an error                                                               |5.420522102033637e-71|
|We shall not at this stage attempt to answer all the objections which may be urged against this fundamental principle                                                 |5.3698467582285195e-71|
|We can not therefore include as part of the value of philosophy any definite set of answers to such questions                                                         |5.3698467582285195e-71|
|This relation therefore is a relation of four terms since Othello also is one of the terms of the relation                                                            |4.555314927658877e-71|
|When what we believe is true it might be supposed that we had achieved a knowledge of what we believe                                                                 |2.121351854743132e-71|
|A mind which believes believes truly when there is a _corresponding_ complex not involving the mind but only its objects                                              |1.8587276807874093e-71|
|There are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter exists and it is important to keep them clear                                                   |1.4898417256772928e-71|
|What this person was acquainted with were certain sense-data which he connected rightly we will suppose with Bismarck 's body                                         |1.1195342447286023e-71|
|What things are there in the universe whose existence is known to us owing to our being acquainted with them                                                          |1.1195342447286023e-71|
|For the probability that Socrates is mortal is greater on our data than the probability that all men are mortal                                                       |1.1195342447286023e-71|
|All knowledge we find must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs and if these are rejected nothing is left                                                         |1.0134698602101113e-71|
|Such as it is it is obtained through acquaintance with the sense-data that make up the appearance of the table                                                        |9.603938396928002e-72|
|Our next chapter therefore will be concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at all                                                         |8.009901750953188e-72|
|Our immediate knowledge of _truths_ may be called _intuitive_ knowledge and the truths so known may be called _self-evident_ truths                                   |8.009901750953188e-72|
|Our derivative knowledge always depends upon some pure _a priori_ knowledge and usually also depends upon some pure empirical knowledge                               |8.009901750953188e-72|
|So long as we are dealing with derivative knowledge we have the test of intuitive knowledge to fall back upon                                                         |4.813904498874435e-72|
|Yet obviously the word 'in ' has a meaning it denotes a relation which holds between me and my room                                                                   |3.7462171051846827e-72|
|Many philosophers it is true have held that philosophy could establish the truth of certain answers to such fundamental questions                                     |2.677348967902241e-72|
|Nevertheless the probability of the general law is increased by repetitions just as the probability of the particular case is                                         |2.142471508164248e-72|
|we have acquaintance in memory with things which have been data either of the outer senses or of the inner sense                                                      |1.0182665138188765e-73|
|The chief importance of knowledge by description is that it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private experience                                            |2.4771840076634336e-74|
|The problem with which we are now concerned is a very old one since it was brought into philosophy by Plato                                                           |2.4771840076634336e-74|
|The word will be applicable to a number of particular things because they all participate in a common nature or essence                                               |2.4771840076634336e-74|
|such that the opposite would be self-contradictory and secondly for having made evident the philosophical importance of the theory of knowledge                       |2.382500530037187e-74|
|But any statement as to what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong                                                             |1.7236740169079326e-74|
|But if the reality is not what appears have we any means of knowing whether there is any reality at all                                                               |1.7236740169079326e-74|
|It must not be supposed that 'ideas ' in his sense exist in minds though they may be apprehended by minds                                                             |1.7097682040135538e-74|
|Thus a problem arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table supposing there is such a thing                                                          |1.6261765362737045e-74|
|Thus ' a man ' is an ambiguous description and 'the man with the iron mask ' is a definite description                                                                |1.6261765362737045e-74|
|Thus whatever self-evident truths may be obtained from our senses must be different from the sense-data from which they are obtained                                  |1.6261765362737045e-74|
|Thus coherence as the definition of truth fails because there is no proof that there can be only one coherent system                                                  |1.6261765362737045e-74|
|Thus when Othello judges that Desdemona loves Cassio Othello is the subject while the objects are Desdemona and loving and Cassio                                     |1.6261765362737045e-74|
|We shall say that an object is 'known by description ' when we know that it is 'the so-and-so ' i.e                                                                   |1.4862570601241403e-74|
|We can think _of_ a universal and our thinking then exists in a perfectly ordinary sense like any other mental act                                                    |1.4862570601241403e-74|
|This question which at first sight might not seem difficult is really one of the most difficult that can be asked                                                     |1.260812324289753e-74|
|If we can show that such statements as this really deal only with universals our proposition may be regarded as proved                                                |9.332972696554816e-75|
|Hence our knowledge as to physical objects depends throughout upon this possibility of general knowledge where no instance can be given                               |5.144554887316383e-75|
|To assert this is certainly within the scope of what we mean when we state that two and two are four                                                                  |2.511177880240353e-75|
|Our derivative knowledge of things which we call knowledge by _description_ always involves both acquaintance with something and knowledge of truths                  |2.2169669944514777e-75|
|They have supposed that what is of most importance in religious beliefs could be proved by strict demonstration to be true                                            |1.7750417856237323e-75|
|Similarly we may be aware of our feeling pleasure or pain and generally of the events which happen in our minds                                                       |1.332384306358825e-75|
|Yet it would be absurd to say that the reader does not _know_ that the newspaper announces the King 's death                                                          |1.036871603981368e-75|
|Moreover the description required to express the thought will vary for different people or for the same person at different times                                     |7.410320973989042e-76|
|Assuming that there is physical space and that it does thus correspond to private spaces what can we know about it                                                    |5.929896230734148e-76|
|Two physical objects and two other physical objects must make four physical objects even if physical objects can not be experienced                                   |5.929896230734148e-76|
|An example of such principles perhaps the most important example is the inductive principle which we considered in the preceding chapter                              |4.448652441978149e-76|
|The mental act is undoubtedly mental but is there any reason to suppose that the thing apprehended is in any sense mental                                             |6.856307798680968e-78|
|I am absolutely certain that half a minute ago I was sitting in the same chair in which I am sitting now                                                              |5.991582390022672e-78|
|It will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple terms of which the meaning is definite and clear                                                  |4.732267378947007e-78|
|It might happen if Kant is right that to-morrow our nature would so change as to make two and two become five                                                         |4.732267378947007e-78|
|It seems plain that it is not thought which produces the truth of the proposition ' I am in my room '                                                                 |4.732267378947007e-78|
|It does not exist in Edinburgh any more than in London for it relates the two and is neutral as between them                                                          |4.732267378947007e-78|
|It is obviously unnecessary to have an individual acquaintance with the whole human race in order to understand what our proposition means                            |4.732267378947007e-78|
|It is that we may sometimes know a general proposition in cases where we do not know a single instance of it                                                          |4.732267378947007e-78|
|Thus there must be intuitive judgements of memory and it is upon them ultimately that all our knowledge of the past depends                                           |4.50090378154914e-78|
|In one sense it must be admitted that we can never prove the existence of things other than ourselves and our experiences                                             |4.1524575025294505e-78|
|In the following chapter we shall consider briefly the reasons in my opinion fallacious which idealists advance in favour of their theory                             |4.1524575025294505e-78|
|In other words can we ever _know_ anything at all or do we merely sometimes by good luck believe what is true                                                         |4.1524575025294505e-78|
|In one way or another if our life is to be great and free we must escape this prison and this strife                                                                  |4.1524575025294505e-78|
|We may now take a survey of the sources of our knowledge as they have appeared in the course of our analysis                                                          |4.113637033280211e-78|
|This property of having a 'sense ' or 'direction ' is one which the relation of judging shares with all other relations                                               |3.4896549246879405e-78|
|If this doubt is raised we find ourselves in the same position as when the doubt about the sunrise was first raised                                                   |2.5831643223235025e-78|
|Hence he inferred the far more doubtful proposition that nothing could be known _a priori_ about the connexion of cause and effect                                    |1.4239011589583124e-78|
|Hence although our general proposition is _a priori_ all its applications to actual particulars involve experience and therefore contain an empirical element         |1.4239011589583124e-78|
|There is however a preliminary question which is rather less difficult and that is What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood                                           |1.1413115443342781e-78|
|There is a confusion when this use of the word 'nature ' is employed between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths                                              |1.1413115443342781e-78|
|Our immediate knowledge of things which we called _acquaintance_ consists of two sorts according as the things known are particulars or universals                    |6.136083571689669e-79|
|Now in order to know whether two propositions can both be true we must know such truths as the law of contradiction                                                   |6.136083571689669e-79|
|1 Kant 's 'thing in itself ' is identical in _definition_ with the physical object namely it is the cause of sensations                                               |5.728590763067804e-79|
|That which many different thoughts of whiteness have in common is their _object_ and this object is different from all of them                                        |4.9129304888561645e-79|
|As the first of the problems connected with knowledge of truths let us examine the nature and scope of our intuitive judgements                                       |4.504762650836375e-79|
|Here we have a relation between two places and it seems plain that the relation subsists independently of our knowledge of it                                         |3.6877506403510237e-79|
|Similarly if Cassio judges that Desdemona loves Othello the constituents of the judgement are still the same but their order is different                             |3.6877506403510237e-79|
|Yet the knowledge of such general propositions is quite vital to a great deal of what is generally admitted to be known                                               |2.869835604709017e-79|
|Its truth is just as indubitable as the truth of the assertion that two phenomena and two other phenomena make four phenomena                                         |1.2312904627672707e-79|
|The mere fact that something has happened a certain number of times causes animals and men to expect that it will happen again                                        |1.8976772207807825e-81|
|But we can not hope to be acquainted directly with the quality in the physical object which makes it look blue or red                                                 |1.320441641726564e-81|
|But for the sake of illustration let us assume that we think of him as 'the first Chancellor of the German Empire '                                                   |1.320441641726564e-81|
|But I perceive that some parts of the page are to the left of other parts and some parts are above other parts                                                        |1.320441641726564e-81|
|But knowledge of truths raises a further problem which does not arise in regard to knowledge of things namely the problem of _error_                                  |1.320441641726564e-81|
|Thus whenever we see a colour we have a sensation _of_ the colour but the colour itself is a sense-datum not a sensation                                              |1.2457524997368226e-81|
|Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance ' which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality ' behind                                                    |1.2457524997368226e-81|
|In this chapter we shall be concerned exclusively with knowledge of things of which in turn we shall have to distinguish two kinds                                    |1.1493101307858983e-81|
|In the next chapter we shall proceed to develop its nature and its bearing upon the questions with which we have been dealing                                         |1.1493101307858983e-81|
|In this case it might seem as though we were dealing with the particulars that have the property rather than with the property                                        |1.1493101307858983e-81|
|In derivative knowledge our ultimate premisses must have some degree of self-evidence and so must their connexion with the conclusions deduced from them              |1.1493101307858983e-81|
|This relation is something although we can not say that it exists _in the same sense_ in which I and my room exist                                                    |9.658607596700638e-82|
|If then we can not trust what we see with the naked eye why should we trust what we see through a microscope                                                          |7.149638312547751e-82|
|If we believe that there is such a universal we shall say that things are white because they have the quality of whiteness                                            |7.149638312547751e-82|
|Hence we can never know any proposition of the form 'this is a physical object ' where 'this ' is something immediately known                                         |3.9410494297213187e-82|
|To make clear what sort of reason there is let us consider for a moment what our acquaintance with particular thoughts really involves                                |1.9237186442018034e-82|
|They must all in some sense partake of a common nature which will be found in whatever is just and in nothing else                                                    |1.3597925515793426e-82|
|They can be apprehended with less effort of abstraction than any others and they seem less removed from particulars than other universals are                         |1.3597925515793426e-82|
|By applying this test it appears that many propositions which might seem to be concerned with particulars are really concerned only with universals                   |1.1337861694559953e-82|
|Before Hume rationalists at least had supposed that the effect could be logically deduced from the cause if only we had sufficient knowledge                          |9.075300565236721e-83|
|On the other hand when a belief is _false_ there is no such complex unity composed only of the objects of the belief                                                  |9.075300565236721e-83|
|Many minds may be acquainted with the same universals hence a relation between universals may be known by acquaintance to many different people                       |5.676767356607154e-83|
|Every complete sentence must contain at least one word which stands for a universal since all verbs have a meaning which is universal                                 |3.407944818066069e-83|
|The view which led to their being so named is a natural one but there are strong reasons for thinking that it is erroneous                                            |5.252358762194249e-85|
|The 'idea ' _justice_ is not identical with anything that is just it is something other than particular things which particular things partake of                     |5.252358762194249e-85|
|The essence of the sort of entity that Plato meant is that it is opposed to the particular things that are given in sensation                                         |5.252358762194249e-85|
|But if we mean this we shall have to admit that what _in this sense_ is in the mind may nevertheless be not mental                                                    |3.6546959361377354e-85|
|It is this question and not our previous question as to the difference between sense-data and the physical object that must now concern us                            |3.6252115223940354e-85|
|It is often said as though it were a self-evident truism that we can not know that anything exists which we do not know                                               |3.6252115223940354e-85|
|It should be observed that in all cases of general principles particular instances dealing with familiar things are more evident than the general principle           |3.6252115223940354e-85|
|It is common to think of relations as though they always held between two terms but in fact this is not always the case                                               |3.6252115223940354e-85|
|Thus relations as we shall see more fully in the next chapter must be placed in a world which is neither mental nor physical                                          |3.447972598219824e-85|
|In our present kind we have a single sense-datum which has both colour and shape the colour is red and the shape is round                                             |3.1810410483971724e-85|
|In the first place it is too wide because it is not enough that our premisses should be _true_ they must also be _known_                                              |3.1810410483971724e-85|
|If this were so we should be involved in a definite contradiction if we attempted to deny anything that could be known _a priori_                                     |1.978864741917451e-85|
|When it is said that light _is_ waves what is really meant is that waves are the physical cause of our sensations of light                                            |1.244918330929721e-85|
|When a belief is true we said there is a corresponding fact in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex                                          |1.244918330929721e-85|
